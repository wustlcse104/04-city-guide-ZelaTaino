        <h2>Stairway to Heaven</h2>
        <h4 class="category">HIKING</h4>
        <p>
          The Stairway to Heaven on Oahu, Hawaii, also known as the Haiku Stairs, is possibly the greatest attraction on the entire island. 3,922 stairs lead up the imposing mountain ridge, often at a vertical incline, with only a hand-rail to catch you from falling into the valley below. Originally the stairs were built in 1942 by the U.S. Navy as a top-secret facility for transmitting radio signals to ships that were sailing in the Pacific Ocean. The stairs were then opened to the public until 1987 when they were deemed unsafe because of disrepair.

        <h3>What You'll Do</h3>
        <p>
          This hike is terribly dangerous and illegal. Those who have been caught have been fined for up to $1000. That's why we suggest you bgein the hike at 2am to by pass the guard of the trail. You want to park in the neighborhood and squeeze past the gate. After you get through the grass you'll see a road. Follow the road and you'll be at the begining of the stairs. Make your way on up and enjoy the most beautiful view Oahu has to offer.

        <h2>Foodland Poke</h2>
        <h4 class="category">FOOD</h4>
        <p>
          Poke means "to section" or "to slice" in Hawaiian. Poke is cubed raw fish dressed with soy sauce, mayo, seaweed, fish eggs, and pretty much anything you'd expect to be mixed with sushi. What's great about poke bowls are the level of customization and amount of variaty in constructing your bowl. My favorite is the California Poke Bowl on white rice. Make sure that you ask the aunty or uncle behind the counter to top it with green onions, white onions, shoyu (soy sauce), and furikake (seaweed rice seasoning). Poke is a tradition for my friends and I after a day spent hiking or at the beach. Pick it up, grab an Arizona Green Tea, sit out in the freeing sun, and feel the island breeze flowing from the mountains.

        <h3>Where You'll Find It</h3>
        <p>
          I know this sounds strange, but I absolutely love the poke from Foodland. Foodland is a grocery store local to the islands. You can find one in almost every city on Oahu. You can find poke in the seafood section and can be ordered over the counter. Here's the address of one in Honolulu.

        <h2>Tantalus Lookout</h2>
        <h4 class="category">SITES</h4>
        <p>
          Mount Tantalus (Puu-ohia) is an extinct cinder cone in the southern Koʻolau Range on the Hawaiian Island of Oʻahu. It also has a summit crater, Tantalus Crater. The cinder cone formed after the demise of Koʻolau Volcano, during a time of rejuvenated stage volcanism in southeastern Oʻahu that also formed Punchbowl Crater, Diamond Head and Koko Head. Tantalus overlooks the modern city of Honolulu, which is built on top of Tantalus cinders. From Tantalus you can see almost all of the southwest side of the island -- from Hawaii Kai to the Ewa. There's also a park at the lookout and makes a pefect place for a picnic. Every part of the mountain can feel the light breeze coming between the valley, counter balancing the heat from the sun, making up perfect Hawaiian weather.

          You can find the outlook near Honolulu on the top of a crater. It can be found up the winding road of a very nice neighborhood. If you peek between the houses you can get a glimpse at the amazing view.

          Ray's Kiawe huli huli Chicken is the real deal! Very much considered a hole in the wall by being a tent that is set up only on the weekends. The chicken is moist, juicy, and aromatic. They have this setup where the chickens are spinning on the rotisserie in plain view, the smell is aromatic and the smoke just beckons you over. Besides a plate lunch, you have the option to order a full or half chicken, pineapple coleslaw, and even their secret sauce.
