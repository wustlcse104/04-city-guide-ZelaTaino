        <h3 class="category">Active</h2>
        <p>
          The Stairway to Heaven on Oahu, Hawaii, also known as the Haiku Stairs, is possibly the greatest attraction on the entire island. 3,922 stairs lead up the imposing mountain ridge, often at a vertical incline, with only a hand-rail to catch you from falling into the valley below. Originally the stairs were built in 1942 by the U.S. Navy as a top-secret facility for transmitting radio signals to ships that were sailing in the Pacific Ocean. The stairs were then opened to the public until 1987 when they were deemed unsafe because of disrepair.

        <h3>What You'll Do</h3>
        <p>
          This hike is terribly dangerous and illegal. Those who have been caught have been fined for up to $1000. That's why we suggest you bgein the hike at 2am to by pass the guard of the trail. You want to park in the neighborhood and squeeze past the gate. After you get through the grass you'll see a road. Follow the road and you'll be at the begining of the stairs. Make your way on up and enjoy the most beautiful view Oahu has to offer.

        <h2>Foodland Poke</h2>
        <h3 class="category">Food</h2>
        <p>
          Poke means "to section" or "to slice" in Hawaiian. Poke is cubed raw fish dressed with soy sauce, mayo, seaweed, fish eggs, and pretty much anything you'd expect to be mixed with sushi. Poke is a tradition for my friends and I after a day spent hiking or at the beach.

        <h3>Where you'll find it</h3>
        <p>
          I know this sounds strange, but I absolutely love the poke from Foodland. Foodland is a grocery store local to the islands. You can find one in almost every city on Oahu. You can find poke in the seafood section and can be ordered over the counter. Here's the address of one in Honolulu.

        <p>
          Ray's Kiawe huli huli Chicken is the real deal! Very much considered a hole in the wall by being a tent that is set up only on the weekends. The chicken is moist, juicy, and aromatic. They have this setup where the chickens are spinning on the rotisserie in plain view, the smell is aromatic and the smoke just beckons you over. Besides a plate lunch, you have the option to order a full or half chicken, pineapple coleslaw, and even their secret sauce.
